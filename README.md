This repository is designed for **mobile multi-robot navigation** using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. It supports both **single-agent** and **multi-agent** training in the [**POGEMA**](https://github.com/Cognitive-AI-Systems/pogema) environment, a grid-based world focused on decentralized pathfinding with partial observability.

We provide implementations of:
- **IPPO** (Independent Proximal Policy Optimization)
- **MAPPO** (Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization)

These algorithms are implemented using the [**SKRL** framework](https://github.com/Toni-SM/skrl), enabling flexible experimentation with state-of-the-art RL approaches. 

## üß≠ Project Objective

This project implements reinforcement learning approaches for **decentralized multi-agent navigation**, where agents learn to reach their respective goals in a shared grid world. The focus is on:
- ü§ù Coordination  
- üö´ Collision avoidance  
- üß† Efficient pathfinding under **partial observability**
